## Terminology

- **Node (Vertex)**: A node (or vertex) of a graph is one of the objects that are connected together by edges.

- **Edge (Link)**: An edge (or link) of a graph is one of the connections between the nodes (or vertices) in the graph.

- **Cycle**: A cycle is a path in a graph where the first node is connected to the last node, forming a closed loop. In an undirected graph, this connection is through bidirectional edges, while in a directed graph, it is through directed edges.

- **Bridge (Cut Edge)**: A bridge (or cut edge) is an edge in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components, resulting in more individual graphs. This indicates that the edge is a weak point, bottleneck, or vulnerability in the graph.

- **Articulation Point**: Similar to bridges, there are also articulation points, which are nodes whose removal increases the number of connected components, resulting in more individual graphs. Articulation points often indicate a weak point, bottleneck, or vulnerability in the graph.
